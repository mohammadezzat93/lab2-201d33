> bigger than
< smaller than
>= bigger than and equal
<= smaller than or equal
!= NOT equal value

!== NOT equal to data type and value
'5' !== 5 =>true
**logical operators:
AND
&&
its only true if two of them are true
OR
||
its only false when both of them are false

1)function Declaration:
you can use it before it was given a value
function funcName(parameters){
